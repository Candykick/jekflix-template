# About

 Hello, World! I’m Candykick, the Android developer in Seoul, Korea. I worked for Indicar Tuning in Korea for 3 years. And I made ‘Indicar Tuning’, the 3D Virtual Car Tuning Application.(Sadly, it is no longer serviced.  
 I made this blog for reminding me of my skills and knowledge. I learned lots of programming skills and knowledge by my working and mentoring. But I have difficulty to remind them, because my skills are not systematically learned. So, I’m trying to remind them by writing posts on my blog.  
 If you have any questions about my posts, feel free to comment it. I will check it out within 2~3 days, and send you a reply. Thank you for visiting my blog!
